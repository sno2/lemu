![./lemu.svg](lemu.svg)

A toolkit for LEGv8, an academic ISA inspired by ARMv8 described in
_Computer Organization And Design Arm Edition_.

## Features

- **LEGv8 Emulator**: Assemble and execute LEGv8 code (`lemu <file>`).
- **Command-Line Debugger**: Set breakpoints, step through instructions, and inspect registers (`lemu -d <file>`).
- **Language Server (LSP)**: Syntax and assembler errors, goto definition, and hover information in your editor
- **VS Code Extension**: Instruction snippets and syntax highlighting. Requires a `lemu` executable.

## Usage

```
Lemu: A LEGv8 toolkit.

Usage:
    -h, --help           Display this help and exit.
    -z, --zero-page      Provide a non-standard memory space of 4096 bytes starting from 0x0.
    -l, --limit-errors   Limit to the first 3 compile errors.
    -d, --debug          Enable debugging.
    <file>               Assemble and run the file.
    --stdio              Start the LSP (used by editors).
```

## Building

Use `zig build`. Relevant project-specific options from `zig build -h`:

```
  -Dtarget=[string]            The CPU architecture, OS, and ABI to build for
  -Dcpu=[string]               Target CPU features to add or subtract
  -Doptimize=[enum]            Prioritize performance, safety, or binary size
                                 Supported Values:
                                   Debug
                                   ReleaseSafe
                                   ReleaseFast
                                   ReleaseSmall
  -Dlsp=[bool]                 Include LSP support (defaults to true)
  -Ddebugger=[bool]            Include debugger support (defaults to true)
  -Dstrip=[bool]               Strip debug information
```

## Compliance

The goal is to maintain instruction encoding and emulation compliance. However,
there are still non-standard instructions such as `PRNT`, to enable
printf-debugging.

Please open issues for correctness problems.

## Performance

The emulator is optimized enough to compete with `legv8emul` for most programs.
However, lemu has a slower startup time and usually consumes about 10% more
memory compared to `legv8emul`.

Feel free to open issues for performance problems.

## Testing

Run `zig build test` to run all of the behavior and syntax tests (located in
the `test` folder).

Run `zig build fuzz` to run random programs against a `legv8emul` executable.
This is available to students at Iowa State University taking COM S 3210 and has
been used to find multiple bugs in the provided emulator.
